# Exoplanet-Classification
Sloan Digital Sky Survey data exploration
Final project for PC120: Topics in Physics: Cosmology, Antigravity, and the Runaway Universe, a class I took at Colorado College during high school. Idea was to train a machine learning model to identify star systems containing exoplanets using spectral data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey for training data and data from the Keppler space telescope to verify the data. Ended up having trouble with .h5 files so I ended up using stellar images instead of spectral data. I seem to remember successfully training some models using Keras, although the amount of data was insufficient to get reliable results. Also, a lot of the images were false color so I would have been surprised if it worked.
